# File Manager GUI (Python)

This tool allows users to perform common file operations through an intuitive interface, such as:

- Opening files
- Copying files
- Deleting files
- Renaming files
- Moving files
- Creating directories

The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight file handling utility built entirely in Python.
